# Hyper-Local Resource Mapper

## About the Project

This is a personal tool for cataloging unique, informal "resources" in your immediate area that aren't on standard maps. It's like your personal digital guide to hidden gems in your neighborhood, office, or home. This project helps you capture your own observations and needs, creating a truly personalized "map" of your world.

## Unique Premise

This project stands out because it focuses on:

* **Informal Data:** It's for things like "the quiet bench for reading" or "the neighbor who lends tools"â€”stuff you won't find on Google Maps.
* **User-Defined Categories:** You create your own categories for resources, like "Shade Spot" or "Wildlife Viewing."
* **Practical & Personal:** It helps organize specific, informal knowledge that only you might know, making it accessible.

## Features

* Add new resources with custom details.
* Define your own resource categories.
* Use descriptive locations (e.g., "Next to the red mailbox").
* View all your saved resources.
* Filter resources by category.
* Data is saved to a file, so your map grows over time.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* (Optional for saving data): Standard Python modules for file handling (like `csv` or `json`).

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hyper-local-resource-mapper.git](https://github.com/your-username/hyper-local-resource-mapper.git)
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username` and the repository name.)
2.  **Go to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd hyper-local-resource-mapper
    ```
3.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Or your main script's name, like `resource_mapper.py`)

## Usage

When you run the program, you'll see a menu:

* **Add:** Enter details for a new resource (name, type, location, notes).
* **View:** See a list of all your added resources.
* **Filter:** Enter a category name (e.g., "Shade Spot") to see matching resources.
* **Exit:** Save your data and close the program.

## Future Ideas

* Simple text-based map visualization.
* Search by keywords.
* Add a "best time of day" for resources.
* Allow deleting or editing resources.
* Add a simple rating system.
